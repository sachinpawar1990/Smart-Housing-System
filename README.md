IoT based Automatic PUB Meter Reading System

Instead of the current manual process of PUB Meter reading in the Singapore, this system tries to do Optical Character Recognition of the meter readings with the help of Camera Sensors and sends to the server thereby eliminating the manual intervention.
Timely alerts are sent to the consumer about the PUB consumption.
This gives a cost-effective and simple solution to the existing cumbersome process.
